# graphics.cpp

basic 3d graphics engine written in c++ using some utility from sdl library
no ui at the moment
all objects need to be created in main function and given as a vector to GraphicsWindow class
hopefully will make more detailed instructions down the line when a more solid prototype is here

should work only for linux atm! chrono wont work for mac and idk if sdl works for windows

work in progress!!
